🚗 Car Parking System using Verilog (FSM-Based Digital Design)

A digital logic project implemented using Verilog HDL, demonstrating the use of Finite State Machines (FSM), counters, and combinational/sequential logic to build an automated car parking gate control system.

📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a smart parking system with the following features:

- Detects vehicle entry and exit using sensors
- Uses an FSM to manage gate open/close sequences
- Includes timing logic, safety interlocks, and parking capacity control
- This project was verified using simulation tools like ModelSim.

⚙️ System Features

- 🚘 Car entry detection
- 🚙 Car exit detection
- 🚧 Gate control via FSM
- 🧮 Parking slot counter
- ⏱️ Timer-based open/close sequence
- 🧪 Complete testbench for simulation
- 🧠 Finite State Machine (FSM)

Typical states used:

- IDLE
- WAIT_FOR_PASSWORD
- ACCEPT_PASS
- DENIED_PASS
- STOP

📘 Tools Used

- Verilog HDL
- ModelSim / Vivado / Icarus Verilog
