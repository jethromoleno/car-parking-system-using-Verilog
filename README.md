<h2>📌 Project Overview</h2>

This project simulates a smart parking system with the following features:

- Detects vehicle entry and exit using sensors
- Uses an FSM to manage gate open/close sequences
- Includes timing logic, safety interlocks, and parking capacity control
- This project was verified using simulation tools like ModelSim.
